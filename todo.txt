Finish tokenizer

Add file reading capacity to main language so that I can run actual tests here

Start working on real parser I guess?

After that I can start simplifying and optimizing stuff, and then figure out
how to emit JavaScript and later LLVM.

And not to mention typechecking, of course.


Remember to use ulimit to set stack size limit, and --stack-size to node as
well. Currently I can parse parse.vzp with a stack size of 75000 kb, although
that will probably be higher for the later versions.
