Start optimizing stuff, and figure out how to emit LLVM!

And not to mention typechecking, of course.


Remember to use ulimit to set stack size limit, and --stack-size to node as
well. Currently it works with a stack size of 9000 kb, but I'd like to try and
bring this down to where I don't have to up the limit anymore.


One thing we eventually need to do is re-configure the tokenizer so that a
program of the form

let f = +
f(1,2)

is regarded as acceptable. Basically, this means not automatically deleting the
semicolon after + when it's preceded by =, but it's a low-priority change
because you can get around it easily by putting the + in parentheses.



For typechecking: 

We need to figure out how to handle imports. There are a couple of options, and
they're all pretty obvious, but there's some thinking to be done before we
commit to one. 

We should be removing the type information from lambda params before we get to
transform. There will probably be a "deoverload" step or something like that,
and that would be the obvious place to do that.
