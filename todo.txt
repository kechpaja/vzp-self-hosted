Start optimizing stuff, and figure out how to emit LLVM!

And not to mention typechecking, of course.


Remember to use ulimit to set stack size limit, and --stack-size to node as
well. Currently it works with a stack size of 9000 kb, but I'd like to try and
bring this down to where I don't have to up the limit anymore.


One thing we eventually need to do is re-configure the tokenizer so that a
program of the form

let f = +
f(1,2)

is regarded as acceptable. Basically, this means not automatically deleting the
semicolon after + when it's preceded by =, but it's a low-priority change
because you can get around it easily by putting the + in parentheses.
