As the name suggests, this is an attempt to write a self-hosted compiler in
VZP. I intend to target both JavaScript (so I can generate something that's
both portable and usable on the internet) and LLVM, although the former will
come first.

Nothing here should be considered production-ready. Do not attempt to write
programs that actually need to work in this language. I can _guarantee_ that
there are still serious bugs, and you _will_ encounter unexpected behavior. For
the foreseeable future, consider this project to be for play only.
